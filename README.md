# csvmerge

Ruby scripts to merge various evolved database schema variations.

This is all rather project-specific but it may serve as an example of Ruby *poetry mode.*

It turns out that most of the parens in Ruby are optional, or at least,
don't need to be attached to the method name.

Code written in this mode may not meet any given employer's coding standards,
but it works fine and has a beauty all of its own.
